# 财票通app / cptapp

在当代，许多企业面临着财务资料整理繁琐复杂的挑战，而现有的解决方案往往效率低下。因此，我计划开发一款名为“财票通”的财务相关应用程序，旨在解决企业财务资料整理过程中的困难和挑战。

问题描述：许多企业在进行财务资料整理时面临着繁琐复杂的问题，包括收据和发票管理、账单跟踪、报销管理等。

In modern times, many enterprises are faced with the challenge of financial data consolidation, and the existing solutions are often inefficient. Therefore, I plan to develop a finance-related application called Caipiaotong, which aims to solve the difficulties and challenges in the process of organizing corporate financial data. 
 
Problem description: Many enterprises are faced with cumbersome and complex problems when sorting out financial information, including receipt and invoice management, bill tracking, reimbursement management, etc.

## App 技术介绍 / App Technology Introduction

主要是dio来进行api，用shared_preferences插件来进行TokenStorage（存储令牌），还进行了数据全局存储。创建了账单的类来进行api的调用和获取。



It is mainly dio to carry out api, TokenStorage (storage token) with shared_preferences plug-in, and global data storage. A billing class is created to make api calls and retrievals.
